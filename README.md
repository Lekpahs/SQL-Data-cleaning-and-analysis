# SQL-Data-cleaning-and-analysis
this is an analysis from a call center to check the performace rate of the employees based on customer feedback, we checked the number of negative,very negative,positive and very positive feedbacks from all the states and found out which ones were doing really badly.

The call center industry depends solely on customer satisfaction, which is inevitable in any industry. Here as a data analyst i decided to provide analysis of the call centers dataset to answer the following Questions.

a) How are they doing in terms of Customer Satisfaction?  which is measured by the Customer Sentiments in the dataset.
b) How are the Different states doing in terms of Customer Satisfaction?
c) What channels of cummunication with the customers are yielding good or bad results?
d) Lastly to really know how a station is really doing ,i wanted to check the negative sentiments along side the positive for each state.
